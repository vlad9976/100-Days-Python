# 100 Days of Python — Day 5

Welcome to **Day 5** of my _100 Days of Python_ journey!  
Today was all about getting comfortable with **`for` loops**, the **`range()`** function, basic **algorithmic challenges**, and a first **mini‑project**: a command‑line Password Generator.

## 🗂️ Repository contents

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `fizzbuzz.py` | Classic FizzBuzz challenge for numbers 1 – 100. |
| `loops.py` | Simple demonstration of iterating over a list with `for`. |
| `max_func.py` | Manual re‑implementation of Python’s built‑in `max()` to find the highest score. |
| `score.py` | Manual summation of a list of integers using a loop. |
| `range.py` | Experiments with the `range()` function + Gauss summation of 1 – 100. |

## 🚀 Quick start

```bash
# Clone the repository (or download the ZIP from GitHub)
git clone https://github.com/<your‑user>/100‑days‑of‑python‑day‑5.git
cd 100‑days‑of‑python‑day‑5

# Run any script with Python 3
python fizzbuzz.py
python loops.py
python max_func.py
python score.py
python range.py
```

> **Prerequisite:** Python 3.8+ installed and available in your `PATH`.

## 🤹‍♂️ What I practiced today

* Building `for` loops with lists and `range()`.
* Writing conditional logic with `if…elif…else`.
* Implementing basic algorithms manually (FizzBuzz, max‑finder, sum‑accumulator).
* Manipulating lists: `append`, `shuffle`, and `map` + `join`.
* Using the `random` module to create secure‑ish passwords.

---

## 📌 Next improvement ideas

* Refactor the password generator into functions and add type hints.
* Introduce input validation and error handling.
* Write unit tests with **pytest**.
* Package the password generator as a CLI tool (`argparse`).
