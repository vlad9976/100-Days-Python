# 🪨📄✂️ Rock Paper Scissors – Day 4 Final Project

This is the final project for **Day 4** of the **100 Days of Python** course by Angela Yu on Udemy.  
It implements a simple interactive **Rock Paper Scissors** game using core concepts like:

- Lists
- User Input
- Conditionals
- Indexing
- Random Module
- ASCII Art

---

## 🎮 How It Works

The game prompts the user to input a number:
- `0` for **Rock**
- `1` for **Paper**
- `2` for **Scissors**

The computer randomly selects one of the three options.  
Then, the result is displayed as either:
- ✅ Win
- ❌ Lose
- ⚖️ Draw

---

## 🧠 Key Concepts Used

- `random.randint()` to simulate the computer’s choice
- Multiline strings for ASCII visuals
- `input()` function to collect user input
- Integer casting & index referencing
- Nested `if-elif-else` logic for game outcomes

---
